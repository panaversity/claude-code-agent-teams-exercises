# Deliverables Requiring Review Workflows

Design a review and approval workflow for each of these three deliverable types.

## Deliverable 1: Weekly Client Status Report

**Context**: Your consulting firm sends weekly status reports to clients every Friday. These reports summarize work completed, decisions needed, risks identified, and plans for next week. A bad status report can damage client trust -- a missed risk or inaccurate progress claim can torpedo a $200K engagement.

**Typical Contents**:

- Executive summary (3-5 bullets)
- Work completed this week (with evidence: deliverables, meetings, artifacts)
- Decisions needed from the client (with deadlines)
- Risks and issues (red/yellow/green status)
- Plan for next week
- Budget burn rate and forecast

**Stakeholders**:

- Report writer (consultant doing the work)
- Project manager (responsible for accuracy)
- Engagement partner (signs off on client-facing communications)
- Client (receives the report)

**Common Failure Modes**:

- Saying "on track" when actually behind schedule
- Missing a risk that the client discovers independently
- Inconsistent numbers between status report and invoices
- Sending the report late (after 5 PM Friday)
- Including internal-only information in client-facing report

## Deliverable 2: Technical Blog Post

**Context**: Your company publishes technical blog posts to establish thought leadership and drive inbound leads. Posts go on your website and are promoted on LinkedIn and Twitter. A factually wrong technical post damages credibility with the engineering audience you're trying to reach.

**Typical Contents**:

- Title and meta description (SEO-optimized)
- Introduction with hook (why should the reader care?)
- Technical content (code examples, architecture diagrams, benchmarks)
- Practical takeaways (what can the reader do with this knowledge?)
- Call to action (try our product, read related posts)

**Stakeholders**:

- Author (engineer who wrote the post)
- Technical reviewer (senior engineer who validates accuracy)
- Editor (marketing team member who reviews for clarity and tone)
- SEO specialist (checks keywords, meta tags, internal links)
- Marketing director (final approval for publication)

**Common Failure Modes**:

- Code examples that don't actually work
- Benchmarks without methodology or reproducibility
- Clickbait title that doesn't match content
- Missing alt text on images (accessibility)
- Publishing without SEO optimization
- Tone that's too academic for the target audience

## Deliverable 3: Legal Contract Amendment

**Context**: Your company occasionally amends contracts with vendors or clients. Amendments modify pricing, scope, timelines, or terms. An incorrect amendment can create legal liability, financial exposure, or customer dissatisfaction.

**Typical Contents**:

- Amendment number and reference to original contract
- Specific clauses being modified (with old and new text)
- Effective date
- Impact summary (what changes for each party)
- Signature blocks for both parties

**Stakeholders**:

- Contract drafter (usually a business person writing the amendment)
- Legal counsel (reviews for legal correctness and risk)
- Finance (validates any pricing/payment changes)
- Department head (confirms business intent)
- Signatory (authorized to sign on behalf of the company)

**Common Failure Modes**:

- Modifying a clause that conflicts with another unchanged clause
- Wrong effective date (before board approval, during blackout periods)
- Missing the impact on related agreements (master agreement vs SOW)
- Unauthorized signatory (person who signed doesn't have authority for this amount)
- Failing to get counterparty legal review before signing
- Not updating the contract management system after signing
