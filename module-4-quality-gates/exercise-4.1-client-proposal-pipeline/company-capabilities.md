# NorthStar Consulting Group: Capabilities Overview

## Who We Are

NorthStar Consulting helps mid-market companies ($50M-$500M revenue) modernize their operations through practical, people-first digital transformation. Founded in 2019, we've completed 45+ engagements across manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, and professional services.

## Our Approach: "Practical Transformation"

We don't believe in rip-and-replace. Our methodology:

1. **Listen First** -- 2-week immersion in the client's actual operations
2. **Map the Gaps** -- Technology audit + process mapping + stakeholder interviews
3. **Quick Wins, Then Big Wins** -- Deliver value in weeks, not years
4. **Build Capability** -- Train internal teams to sustain changes without us
