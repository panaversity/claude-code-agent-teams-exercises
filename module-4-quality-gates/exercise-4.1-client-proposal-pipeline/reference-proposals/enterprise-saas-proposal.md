# NorthStar Consulting: Proposal for TechServe Solutions

**Prepared for**: TechServe Solutions (B2B SaaS, $180M ARR, 650 employees)
**Engagement**: Customer Operations Digital Transformation
**Submitted**: September 2025
**Result**: WON -- engagement completed January 2026

## Executive Summary

TechServe Solutions has grown 40% annually for three years, but customer operations hasn't kept pace. Support ticket volume is up 200%, customer onboarding takes 45 days (industry average: 14), and your NPS has dropped from 62 to 41. We propose a 16-week engagement to modernize your customer operations: automated onboarding workflows, a unified customer health dashboard, and a training program that turns your support team from reactive firefighters into proactive customer success partners.

## Understanding Your Situation

Your growth is both your greatest achievement and your biggest risk. Three years of 40% growth means:

- Your support team of 25 is handling volume designed for a team of 60
- Onboarding processes designed for 10 customers/month now handle 40
- Customer data lives in 6 different systems with no single view

But your fundamentals are strong: low churn among properly onboarded customers (3% annual), high expansion revenue (130% net retention when customers succeed), and a support team that consistently gets praised in reviews despite being overwhelmed.

The problem isn't your people -- it's your systems.

## Proposed Approach

### Phase 1: Discovery (Weeks 1-3, $45,000)

- Shadow 10 customer onboarding journeys end-to-end
- Interview all 25 support team members
- Map current systems and data flows
- Benchmark against SaaS industry peers

### Phase 2: Design (Weeks 4-6, $35,000)

- Automated onboarding workflow design
- Customer health score model
- Unified dashboard architecture
- Training curriculum outline

### Phase 3: Build (Weeks 7-14, $95,000)

- Implement automated onboarding in your existing Salesforce instance
- Build customer health dashboard connecting Salesforce, Intercom, and Stripe
- Create self-service onboarding portal for customers
- Develop and deliver 40-hour training program for support team

### Phase 4: Optimize (Weeks 15-16, $15,000)

- Measure results against baseline
- Adjust automation rules based on real data
- Hand off documentation and playbooks to internal team
- Define ongoing optimization cadence

**Total Investment: $190,000**
