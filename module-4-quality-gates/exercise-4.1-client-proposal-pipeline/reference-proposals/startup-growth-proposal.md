# NorthStar Consulting: Proposal for RapidScale

**Prepared for**: RapidScale (Growth-stage startup, $8M ARR, 45 employees)
**Engagement**: Operations Foundation for Scale
**Submitted**: November 2025
**Result**: WON -- engagement in progress

## Executive Summary

RapidScale is at an inflection point: you've found product-market fit and your ARR has tripled in 18 months. But your operations are held together with spreadsheets, manual processes, and heroic individual effort. Before your next funding round (targeting Q2 2026), you need operational foundations that can support 3x growth without 3x headcount. We propose an 8-week engagement focused on three quick wins: CRM implementation, financial reporting automation, and a hiring operations workflow.

## Understanding Your Situation

You're a 45-person company running on tools designed for 10 people:

- Sales uses a shared Google Sheet as a "CRM" (currently 2,400 rows)
- Finance closes the books manually each month (takes 5 days)
- Hiring is managed through email threads between founders and recruiters
- Customer data lives in the CEO's head and a Notion database

This is normal for your stage. But it becomes a crisis at 100 people, and investors will ask about operational maturity in due diligence.

## Proposed Approach

### Phase 1: Prioritize (Weeks 1-2, $25,000)

- Audit all operational processes
- Identify the 3 highest-impact quick wins
- Build business cases for each
- Get founder buy-in on priorities

### Phase 2: Implement (Weeks 3-7, $55,000)

- Quick Win 1: HubSpot CRM setup and data migration from spreadsheets
- Quick Win 2: QuickBooks Online setup with automated reporting
- Quick Win 3: Lever ATS setup with structured interview process
- Train team on all three tools

### Phase 3: Stabilize (Week 8, $10,000)

- Verify adoption and fix issues
- Create runbooks for ongoing operations
- Hand off to designated internal owners
- Define "when to call us back" triggers

**Total Investment: $90,000**

## Team

- Robert Chen (Senior Consultant) -- Lead consultant, on-site 4 days/week
- Jennifer Walsh (Change Management) -- Training and adoption, 2 days/week

## Why NorthStar for a Startup

We know you're thinking: "Do we really need consultants at our size?" Fair question. Here's why it makes sense now:

- You can't afford to hire an ops person AND implement tools AND keep selling. We give you operational foundations in 8 weeks so you can focus on growth.
- We've done this exact engagement 6 times for companies between $5M-$15M ARR. We know which tools work at your scale (and which don't).
- Our $90K engagement replaces what would take a $120K/year ops hire 6+ months to figure out.
