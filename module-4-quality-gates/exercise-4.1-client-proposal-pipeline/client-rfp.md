## Background

## What We Need

### Phase 1: Assessment (Weeks 1-4)

- Audit current technology stack and processes
- Interview 20+ stakeholders across departments
- Identify quick wins vs long-term investments
- Benchmark against industry peers

### Phase 2: Strategy (Weeks 5-8)

- Digital transformation roadmap (18-month horizon)
- Technology recommendation with vendor comparisons
- Change management plan (our people are the biggest risk/opportunity)
- ROI projections for each recommended initiative

### Phase 3: Quick Wins Implementation (Weeks 9-16)

- Implement 2-3 quick wins identified in Phase 1
- Train staff on new tools
- Measure results and adjust
- Hand off to internal team with documentation

## What We Don't Want

- Generic "digital transformation" buzzword soup

- A plan that requires us to hire 10 developers we can't afford
- Recommendations that ignore our workforce's capabilities
