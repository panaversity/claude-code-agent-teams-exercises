# Capstone B -- Apply Agent Teams to Your Domain

**Integration Challenge** -- Design and run an agent team for a real task in your professional domain.

## Goal

Take a complex task from your actual work (or a realistic simulation) and decompose it into parallel workstreams that benefit from independent investigation and inter-agent discussion. This capstone proves you can transfer the patterns from code review to any domain.

## No Starter Files

This capstone is intentionally open-ended. You bring the project, the problem, and the domain expertise.

## Your Tasks

### Step 1: Choose a Real Task

Pick a task that has these properties:

- **Multiple angles**: It can be investigated from 2-4 different perspectives
- **Discussion value**: Findings from one angle inform another angle
- **Clear completion**: You'll know when the team has done enough

Examples from different domains:
- **Marketing**: Analyze a campaign from brand, performance, and competitor angles
- **Research**: Investigate a topic from methodology, literature, and data angles
- **Product**: Evaluate a feature from user, technical, and business angles
- **Legal**: Review a contract from compliance, risk, and commercial angles
- **Education**: Assess curriculum from pedagogy, accessibility, and engagement angles

### Step 2: Design the Team

Write down before creating:

1. How many teammates? (2-4 recommended)
2. What is each teammate's specialty?
3. What files or documents will each teammate analyze?
4. What should teammates share with each other?
5. What should the final output look like?

### Step 3: Write the Prompt

Create a prompt that includes:
- Clear role definitions for each teammate
- Specific scope boundaries (what each teammate should and should NOT investigate)
- Instructions for inter-agent sharing
- The desired output format

### Step 4: Run and Observe

Create the team and observe:
- Do teammates stay in their lanes?
- Does inter-agent discussion add value?
- Does the lead synthesize effectively?

### Step 5: Write a Retrospective

After the team finishes, document:

1. **Task description**: What were you trying to accomplish?
2. **Team design**: How many teammates, what roles?
3. **What worked**: Which aspects of the team approach added value?
4. **What didn't**: Where did coordination overhead outweigh the benefit?
5. **Single-agent comparison**: Could one agent have done this equally well?
6. **Cost assessment**: Was the multi-agent cost justified?
7. **Pattern extracted**: What reusable team pattern did you discover?

## Reflection

- What properties of your task made it suitable (or unsuitable) for agent teams?
- How would you explain the value of agent teams to a colleague in your field?
- What's the minimum task complexity where teams provide value over a single agent?
- Could you create a reusable team template (prompt + roles) for recurring tasks in your domain?
