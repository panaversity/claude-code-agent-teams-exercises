# The Original Prompt (Flawed)

```
I need to refactor the authentication system in this project.
The auth module needs to switch from session-based to JWT auth.
Create a team to help.

Things that need to change:
- auth.js needs JWT signing/verification
- middleware.js needs token extraction from headers
- routes.js needs login/register endpoints updated
- tests need to be updated for JWT flow
```

**Note**: This prompt was used WITHOUT delegate mode enabled. The user did not press Shift+Tab.
