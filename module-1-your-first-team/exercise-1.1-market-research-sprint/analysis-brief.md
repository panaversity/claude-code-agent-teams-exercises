# Market Analysis Brief

**From**: Jordan Chen, VP of Business Development
**To**: Research Team
**Date**: February 2026
**Subject**: Premium Pet Food Delivery -- Market Entry Assessment

## Request

I need a comprehensive analysis of the premium pet food delivery market to decide whether we should enter this space. The board meeting is in two weeks and I need a clear recommendation.

## Three Angles to Cover

### 1. Market Sizing & Trends

- How large is the premium pet food delivery market?
- Which segments are growing fastest?
- What's the projected market size by 2028?
- Are there underserved segments we could target?

### 2. Competitive Landscape

- Who are the key players?
- What are their strengths and weaknesses?
- Where are the gaps in current offerings?
- How defensible are their positions?

### 3. Entry Strategy Recommendation

- Should we enter this market? (Go/No-Go)
- If go: which segment should we target first?
- What would our differentiation be?
- What's the estimated investment needed for the first 12 months?

## What I Don't Need

- Don't boil the ocean. I need a focused analysis, not a 50-page report.
- Skip the generic "pet industry is growing" intro. I know that. Give me specifics.
- If the answer is "don't enter," say so clearly with reasons.

## Format

- Executive summary (3-5 bullet points)
- Supporting analysis for each angle
- Clear recommendation with confidence level (high/medium/low)
