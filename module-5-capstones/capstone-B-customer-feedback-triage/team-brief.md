# Customer Feedback Analysis Brief

**From**: Alex Rivera, Head of Product
**To**: Analysis Team
**Date**: February 2026

## What I Need

We have 200 customer reviews from the past 90 days that I haven't had time to properly analyze. I need a structured analysis that my product team can act on in our next sprint planning (February 20).

## Specifically

1. **Theme categorization**: Group every review into themes. I want to know what people are talking about, not just star ratings.

2. **Top 5 critical issues**: What are the 5 things causing the most pain? Rank them by a combination of:
   - Frequency (how many reviews mention it)
   - Severity (1-star reviews weigh more than 3-star reviews)
   - Revenue risk (Enterprise customer complaints weigh more than Core)

3. **Sentiment trend**: Are things getting better or worse? Compare the most recent 30 days vs the prior 60 days.

4. **Action plan**: For each of the top 5 issues, give me:
   - A one-sentence summary of the problem
   - Number of affected reviews (with IDs so I can read them)
   - Suggested fix (realistic for a 2-week sprint)
   - Confidence level (High/Medium/Low based on data volume)

## What I Don't Need

- A summary that just says "customers want better performance." I know that. Tell me WHICH performance issue, HOW bad, and WHAT to do.
- Sentiment analysis without actionable recommendations
- Generic best practices. I want recommendations specific to OUR data.

## Format

Keep it concise. I'll read a 3-page report. I won't read a 15-page report.
