R002,2026-02-07,Enterprise,180,4,Feature Request,Need Gantt dependencies,"Love the new Gantt chart but without task dependencies it's just a pretty timeline. When are real dependencies coming?"
R003,2026-02-07,Core,22,5,Praise,Best PM tool we've tried,"Switched from Asana 6 months ago and haven't looked back. Simple clean and just works for our small team."
R004,2026-02-06,Pro,65,1,Complaint,API v2 broke our integration,"You deprecated API v1 with 30 days notice and the v2 docs are incomplete. Our Zapier workflows have been broken for 2 weeks."
R005,2026-02-06,Pro,38,3,Support Issue,Can't figure out custom fields,"Upgraded to Pro specifically for custom fields but can't find where to set them up. Support responded in 3 days which felt slow."

R008,2026-02-04,Pro,55,3,Feature Request,Need better time tracking reports,"Time tracking exists but the reports are too basic. Can't break down by project AND team member AND date range."
R009,2026-02-04,Enterprise,150,1,Complaint,Performance is unacceptable,"Our main project has 600+ tasks and takes 45 seconds to load. At $30/user/month for 150 people this is embarrassing."

R019,2026-01-31,Pro,60,1,Complaint,Performance on large projects is terrible,"Our 400-task project takes over 30 seconds to load. We're paying for Pro and can't even load our main project without waiting."

R041,2026-01-24,Pro,48,3,Feature Request,AI suggestions need context awareness,"The AI task suggestion feature suggested I assign a design task to our backend developer. It needs to learn team roles."
R042,2026-01-24,Enterprise,170,2,Complaint,Pricing increase feels unfair,"I know existing customers are grandfathered but we're adding 30 new employees and they have to pay the new higher rate. Feels like a bait and switch."
R043,2026-01-23,Core,22,5,Praise,Couldn't be happier,"6 months in and CloudTask is still the best decision we made for project management. Clean simple effective."
R044,2026-01-23,Pro,60,1,Complaint,Performance makes it unusable for real projects,"Any project over 300 tasks is painfully slow. The loading spinner has become our team's most-seen screen."

R051,2026-01-21,Pro,65,1,Complaint,API v2 migration was a disaster,"No migration guide. Incomplete docs. Changed field names without mapping. This is how you lose developer trust."

R057,2026-01-19,Enterprise,165,1,Complaint,Large project performance is a dealbreaker,"We're an Enterprise customer with 500+ task projects. The 40-second load time is actively hurting our productivity. Evaluating Jira."

R060,2026-01-18,Enterprise,200,4,Feature Request,Gantt chart is promising,"Nice start on the Gantt view. For Enterprise we really need: dependencies milestones and resource allocation. Then it'd replace MS Project."
R061,2026-01-17,Core,20,5,Praise,Best free PM tool,"The Core plan gives us more than most tools' paid plans. List view and Kanban are both excellent."
R062,2026-01-17,Pro,60,2,Bug Report,Duplicate notification nightmare,"Our team of 60 now wastes time reading duplicate notifications to figure out which is the real update. This is a serious productivity drain."

R067,2026-01-15,Pro,55,1,Complaint,API v2 broke our entire workflow,"We built our onboarding automation on API v1. The v2 migration broke it and your docs don't cover our use case at all."

R088,2026-01-08,Pro,65,1,Complaint,API rate limiting is crippling our integration,"Our daily sync pulls 500 tasks. With v2 rate limits we have to spread it over 2 hours. v1 did it in 5 minutes."

R140,2025-12-21,Pro,48,1,Complaint,Three months of performance issues,"We've reported slow loading 3 times. Each time told 'we're working on it.' It's been 3 months. Are you actually working on it?"
