# Business Idea: The Melt Factory

## Founder's Vision

I want to start a gourmet grilled cheese food truck in Austin, TX. Not your typical American cheese on white bread -- I'm talking about artisan cheeses, locally-sourced bread, creative flavor combinations, and seasonal specials that make people line up around the block.

## The Concept

**Name**: The Melt Factory
**Tagline**: "Crafted Melts, Happy People"
**Location**: Austin, TX (starting in the downtown/South Congress area)
**Target Launch**: Summer 2026

## Why Grilled Cheese?

1. **Universal appeal** -- Everyone loves grilled cheese. It's comfort food with a premium twist.
2. **Low ingredient complexity** -- Unlike sushi or BBQ, the ingredient list is manageable for a food truck.
3. **High margins** -- Artisan bread + quality cheese + premium toppings = $4-6 food cost on a $12-16 sandwich.
4. **Instagram-worthy** -- A perfectly golden, cheese-pulling grilled cheese is social media gold.
5. **Austin culture** -- Austin loves food trucks, local sourcing, and creative food concepts.

## Menu Concept (Draft)

### Signature Melts ($12-16)

- **The Classic Elevated** -- Triple cream brie, aged cheddar, caramelized onions on sourdough
- **The Texan** -- Pepper jack, pulled pork, pickled jalapeños, chipotle aioli on jalapeño cornbread
- **The Truffle Shuffle** -- Gruyère, mushroom duxelles, truffle oil, arugula on brioche
- **The Caprese Melt** -- Fresh mozzarella, heirloom tomato, basil pesto, balsamic glaze on ciabatta
- **The Mac Attack** -- Four-cheese mac and cheese stuffed inside a grilled cheese (yes, really)

### Sides ($4-6)

- Tomato bisque (for dipping, obviously)
- Sweet potato fries with chipotle mayo
- House-made pickle spears

### Drinks ($3-5)

- Local craft sodas
- Fresh-squeezed lemonade
- Cold brew coffee (partner with a local roaster)

## My Background

I've been a home cook and cheese enthusiast for 15 years. I've won 3 local grilled cheese competitions. I currently work in marketing at a tech company (salary: $85K) and have $40K in savings plus $20K from family investment. I plan to quit my job once the truck is cash-flow positive.

## What I Need Help With

- Is the market big enough? How many food trucks are already in Austin?
- What will it ACTUALLY cost to start? (I've heard $50K-$150K for a food truck)
- How quickly can I break even?
- What's my marketing strategy beyond "post on Instagram"?
- Am I being realistic or delusional?

## What I've Already Done

- Researched food truck permits in Austin (City of Austin Mobile Food Vendor permit required)
- Talked to 3 food truck owners informally (they all said parking spots are the hardest part)
- Created a basic Instagram account (@themeltfactory) with 200 followers from friends/family
- Taken a food safety certification course (ServSafe certified)
