## Team Design

### Team Name

`your-team-name`

### Agents

| Agent Name | Role | Responsibility | Input Files | Output |
| ---------- | ---- | -------------- | ----------- | ------ |
|            |      |                |             |        |
|            |      |                |             |        |
|            |      |                |             |        |

### Why These Agents?

For each agent, answer: "Why can't another agent do this work?"

1. Agent 1:
2. Agent 2:
3. Agent 3:

## Task Pipeline

### Tasks

| ID  | Task | Agent | blockedBy | Est. Duration |
| --- | ---- | ----- | --------- | ------------- |
| T1  |      |       | None      |               |
| T2  |      |       |           |               |
| T3  |      |       |           |               |
| T4  |      |       |           |               |

### Dependency Diagram

```
[T1] --> [T2] --> [T4]
     \-> [T3] -/
```

### Critical Path

The longest sequential chain: T* -> T* -> T\_

## Communication Protocol

| From | To  | When | Type           | Content |
| ---- | --- | ---- | -------------- | ------- |
|      |     |      | DM / Broadcast |         |

## Quality Gates

| Gate | What's Checked | Pass Criteria | Who Checks |
| ---- | -------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
|      |                |               |            |

## Starter Files to Create

| File | Format | Row Count / Length | Key Columns / Sections |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
|      |        |                    |                        |

## Reusability Plan

**How often would you run this team?**
(Weekly / Monthly / Per project / Ad hoc)

**What changes between runs?**
(New data files? Different parameters? Same structure?)

**What would you automate?**
(Team creation script? Data preparation? Output formatting?)

## Dry Run Predictions

Before running (or if skipping the run), predict:

| Agent | What It Will Produce | Potential Issues |
| ----- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
|       |                      |                  |
|       |                      |                  |
|       |                      |                  |

**Predicted total cost**: $ \_\_ (based on Capstone A/B experience)

**Biggest risk**: \_\_\_
