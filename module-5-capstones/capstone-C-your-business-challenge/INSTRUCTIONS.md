# Capstone C -- Your Business Challenge

**Agent Teams Capstone: Your Domain** -- Apply agent teams to a real challenge in your professional life

## Goal

Design and (optionally) run an agent team that solves a real business problem from your own professional domain. This is the most valuable exercise in the pack because it creates something you can actually use.

## Prerequisites

Modules 1-4 completed, plus at least one of Capstone A or B.

## What You Have

- `self-assessment.md` -- Guided questions to identify a suitable challenge from your domain
- `planning-worksheet.md` -- Structured template for designing your team

## Your Challenge

### Step 1: Identify Your Problem (15 minutes)

Work through `self-assessment.md` to identify a real business problem that:

- You face regularly (not a one-time task)
- Involves multiple perspectives or skills
- Would benefit from parallel work
- Has clear success criteria

### Step 2: Design Your Team (30 minutes)

Use `planning-worksheet.md` to design:

- Team structure (agents, roles, responsibilities)
- Task pipeline (dependencies, ordering)
- Communication protocol (who talks to whom)
- Quality gates (how do you know the output is good?)
- Starter files (what data/context would you provide?)

### Step 3: Run It (Optional, 30-60 minutes)

If you have the API budget, run your team on a real instance of the problem. If not, dry-run the design by walking through each step manually and predicting what each agent would produce.

### Step 4: Evaluate and Iterate

Whether you ran it or dry-ran it:

- Score your output using the standard rubric
- Identify what you'd change for next time
- Document the team design as a reusable template

## Scoring

| Criteria                    | What to Evaluate                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Comprehensiveness** (1-5) | Does the team design cover all aspects of the problem?           |
| **Actionability** (1-5)     | Could you (or someone else) run this team and get useful output? |
| **Evidence Quality** (1-5)  | Is the design grounded in your actual domain (not hypothetical)? |
| **Team Coordination** (1-5) | Does the team structure actually improve on single-agent work?   |

**Target**: 16/20 or higher (capstone standard).

## Reflection

1. Was the problem you chose well-suited for a team approach? Or would a single agent have been enough?
2. What was the hardest part: identifying the problem, designing the team, or running it?
3. If you were to use this team weekly, what would you automate vs what needs human judgment each time?
4. How would you explain agent teams to a colleague who's never used Claude Code?
5. What's the next business problem you'd tackle with an agent team?

## Tool Note

This exercise can be completed as a design exercise (free) or run in Claude Code (API cost varies by your problem complexity).
