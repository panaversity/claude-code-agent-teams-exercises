## Part 3: Agent Team Fit Assessment

Rate each statement 1-5 (1 = disagree, 5 = agree):

| Statement                                                   | Rating (1-5) |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| This task involves multiple distinct sub-tasks              |              |
| Sub-tasks can be done in parallel (not strictly sequential) |              |
| Different sub-tasks need different "expertise"              |              |
| I can clearly define what "good output" looks like          |              |
| I have (or can create) starter data files for this task     |              |
| I do this task at least monthly                             |              |

**Total score**: \_\_ / 30

- **24-30**: Excellent fit for agent teams. Proceed to planning.
- **18-23**: Good fit. Some aspects may work better as single-agent tasks.
- **12-17**: Marginal fit. Consider whether a single agent with a good prompt would suffice.
- **Below 12**: Probably not a good agent team candidate. Try a different task.
